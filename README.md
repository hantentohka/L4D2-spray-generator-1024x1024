How to use: Drag the picture over the exe or use command line with picture as argument. Vtf file will appear in the same folder as source picture.

REQUIREMENT: Nvidia Texture Tools installed in C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA Corporation\\NVIDIA Texture Tools\\nvcompress.exe or set up in environment variables.

This program converts common format images (jpg, png etc) from any resolution to vtf 1024x1020. If the image is not square, the program will center the image and make the background transparent.

Vtf compression uses DXT1 with 1 alpha bit.

You can build the binary yourself with the command from command.txt or use the precompiled one (vtf.exe)

This program is mainly used to automated L4D2 spray making and not in any way configurable to make different kinds of textures with different parameters and encodings.
